## Contribution/Development Note

Azure Pipelines YAML files can be validated via a JSON Schema.
The Azure DevOps documentation mentions this but asks you to get the project scoped schema, which requires authorization.
[A generic schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-vscode/master/service-schema.json) is also available however and can be helpful for validation.
